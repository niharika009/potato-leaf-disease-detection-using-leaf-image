# potato-leaf-disease-detection-using-leaf-image
The output determines whether a plant has a disease based on the condition of its leaves or if it is healthy. If the plant is diseased, there are two possible diagnoses: late blight or early blight. This process is performed using image processing through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where an image is provided as input.
